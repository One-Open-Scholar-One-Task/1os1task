# One Open Scholar, One Task

In June 2020 a small project was started, to show how small a contribution to Open Research can be.
Each small task can be completed in 15 minutes or less. People can tweet the task with the
[#1os1task]() hashtag. People that complete the hashtag can reply to the proposal with (a link
to) the results and optionally also the hashtag.

This repository collected task proposals, allowing them to be easily found. Moreover, results
can be tracked in this repository.
